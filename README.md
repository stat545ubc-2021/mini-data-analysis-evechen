Eve Chen - STAT 545A 2021 - Mini Data Analysis
================================
Hello! Welcome to my ~~channel~~ repo! 

This repository will contain **Eve (Yixuan) Chen**'s work for **Mini Data Analysis deliverables**, as part of *STAT 545A* (Winter term 1 2021). 

## Files in the repository ðŸ“‚:

There are three milestones for my analysis, work of which is distributed in 3 folders in this repository. Each folder would contain: `1.` the R markdown files with source code, `2.` the knitted markdown files, and `3.` a sub-folder of attached files like figures from the knitted markdown.

**Instructions on how to open and render the markdown (`.md`) and R markdown (`.rmd`) filesï¼š**
- [x]  `.md` files : The markdown files are knitted from the R markdown, it can be read and edited with a normal text editor. But the robust and reproducible way is to edit on the source code in R markdown file of the same name, then knit and update the corresponding markdown file.
- [x] `.rmd` files: The R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. You can use Integrated Development Environment like RStudio to open the files, edit and run the code embedded. You can also render the files into markdown, HTML or PDF formats with RStudio IDE.

## Deliverables ðŸ“” : 

1. [Milestone 1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/tree/main/Milestone%201) (tag [m1.0](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/releases/tag/m1.0), released on **Oct 9**)
    
    The first deliverable contains a work report of some foundamental analysis of 7 semi-tidy datasets from the `datateachr` package. We gradually focus on getting familiar with one dataset of choosing with the `tidyverse` package. And finally we come up with 4 interesting questions that can be answered in the following milestones.
    - Markdown: [mini-project-1.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/blob/main/Milestone%201/mini-project-1.md)
    - R Markdown with source code: [mini-project-1.rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/blob/main/Milestone%201/mini-project-1.rmd)
    - Figures: [mini-project-1 file folder](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/tree/main/Milestone%201/mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm)
  
2. [Milestone 2](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/tree/main/Milestone%202) (tag [m2.0](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mini-data-analysis-evechen/releases/tag/m2.0), released on **Oct 19**)    

    In the second deliverable, we will explore more in depth the concept of tidy data, and investigate further into the 4 research questions that we defined in milestone 1. The questions were slightly modified here so as to optimally integrate what was learned in the class. At the end, 2 refined research questions out of 4 were selected for milestone 3.
