This is the output folder for the csv and R binary files from milestone 3.
================================

The output is a summary table where the *range* (*max*, *min* and contrast) , *mean* and *median* of `flow` across the groups of `extream_type` from the data was computed, to observe the overall range and statistical features of the flow rate recorded as different type.
