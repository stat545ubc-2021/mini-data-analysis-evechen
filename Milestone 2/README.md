================================

**Introduction:**

In the second deliverable, we will explore more in depth the concept of tidy data, and investigate further into the 4 research questions that we defined in milestone 1. The questions were slightly modified here so as to optimally integrate what was learned in the class. At the end, 2 refined research questions out of 4 were selected for further analyses.
