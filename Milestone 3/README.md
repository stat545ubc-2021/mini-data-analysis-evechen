This folder contains the source for Milestone 3
================================

**Introduction:**

In the last milestone, weâ€™ll be sharpening some of the results we obtained from the previous milestones by: manipulating special data types in R including factors and/or dates and times, fitting a model object to the data and extract a result, and reading and writing data as separate files.
